### **# Lab 7: Implementing `chown` and `chmod` Commands**  

## üìå Objective  
Learn how to change file ownership using `chown` and modify file permissions using `chmod` with different options.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Change File Ownership (`chown`)**  
Change the owner of `example.txt` to `user1`:  
```bash
chown user1 example.txt
```

Change both owner and group:  
```bash
chown user1:group1 example.txt
```

Change ownership of a directory and all its contents:  
```bash
chown -R user1:group1 /path/to/directory
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Modify File Permissions (`chmod`)**  

#### **Using Symbolic Mode:**  
Grant execute (`+x`) permission to the owner:  
```bash
chmod u+x example.txt
```

Remove write (`-w`) permission from others:  
```bash
chmod o-w example.txt
```

Grant read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions to all (`u`, `g`, and `o`):  
```bash
chmod ugo+rwx example.txt
```

---

#### **Using Octal Mode:**  
Set file permissions to **read (4), write (2), execute (1)**:  
```bash
chmod 755 example.txt
```
(Owner: `rwx`, Group: `r-x`, Others: `r-x`)  

Make a file **read and write** for owner only:  
```bash
chmod 600 example.txt
```
